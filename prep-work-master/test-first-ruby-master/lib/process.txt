START YOUR TIMER

Read the problem. Make sure you understand what it's looking for and what the output is


Determine what your input is - make sure you understand the format 


Determine what your output should be - write a comment to make sure that you actually return the output :)


Define your assumptions / concepts on how to solve the problem. Briefly, but in sufficient detail.


At every step along the way where you pause to wonder what to do, WRITE DOWN what you plan on doing.


Whenever necessary, create a variable or data structure to store something if it's confusing or cumbersome to calculate, pull, whatever

If it helps, try to remember a problem that was similar to this problem. How was it similar. Make sure you don't write the wrong solution, though
