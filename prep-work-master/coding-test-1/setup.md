# Ruby Setup

## Nitrous.io

It is not required to install Ruby on your own machine before the
coding challenge. The easiest way to start using Ruby is to use
[nitrous.io][nitrous.io]; it is free.

**We've recorded a [video demo][video-demo] of how to use
Nitrous.io**. Here are the key steps:

0. Go to [nitrous.io][nitrous.io] and sign up.
0. After you've signed up and confirmed your email, create your first
   box. **Where it says "Download a Github repo", paste in
   https://github.com/appacademy/prep-work.git**.
0. Nitrous.io will provide a text editor for you to edit Ruby code in
   the browser. You can write Ruby code in the text editor. At the
   bottom is a console, you can run your code in the console.

**You should be able to do all the prepwork using nitrous.io.**

## Advanced Setup

**You do not have to install Ruby on your own machine to do the
prep-work.** When starting out, you want to spend as much time coding
and as little time as possible on banal setup tasks. **Therefore, we
highly recommend you use nitrous.io.**

Setting up Ruby on your machine can be a frustrating process. Setting
up Ruby is not the same as programming; even great Rubyists can be
frustrated by the hoops they have to jump through to setup their
machine. Don't be discouraged if it's difficult!

To install Ruby on Windows, we recommend
[RubyInstaller][ruby-installer]. To install on Mac OSX, look at
[Tokaido][tokaido].

### Text Editor

You also need a proper code editor; Microsoft's notepad or Mac's
TextEdit won't cut it. We recommend you use [Atom][atom].

### Terminal

A lot of Ruby development is done at the command line. Mac users can
use Terminal.app.

Windows users can run `cmd`, which is the Windows command line. Run it
by pressing `Windows Key-R` (launches "run program") and typing `cmd`
into the box.
